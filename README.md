Each file corresponds to the data of the experiment whose name it bears.
Each line corresponds to a trial and are reported: 
- the name of the participant
- the serial number of the trial
- the trial number
- the singleton identifier:    
    * For experiment 1, 0 for no singleton, 1 for the singleton. 
    * For experiments 2, 3 and 4: 1, 2, 3 or 4 for the increasingly different singletons (increasingly bright or increasingly rough).
    * For experiment 5: 1 for the singleton with 2 jnd of brightness and roughness, 2 for the singleton with 2 jnd of brightness and 5 of roughness, 3 for       the singleton with 5 jnd of brightness and 2 of roughness and 4 for the singleton with 5 jnd of brightness and 5 of roughness.
- the position of the target in the sequence
- the response time: measured from the start of the sequence
- the error : 100 if error, 0 if correct
- the target identifier: 0 for short target, 1 for long target
- the given answer: 0 for short target, 1 for long target
